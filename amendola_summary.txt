1. Skim Chapter 40: Discrete Systems
2. Main Topics of Chapter:
	a) Fixed point integration
	b) Cobweb plots
	c) Period 3 cycle
	d) Logistic map
	e) Bifurcation
3. 5 Questions about chapter:
	1) Why does the system that includes sqrt(2) end up converging to a pattern instead?
	2) Why do more fixed points appear once a is passed 3?
	3) Are the amount of curves for bifurcation continuously increasing as a gets bigger or do they stop once a reaches a certain number?
	4) Would the intersecting of the curves y=x and y=f(x) on the cobweb plot be considered the converging point?
	5) Why is chaos so important in dynamical systems?
