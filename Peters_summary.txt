Main topics of chapter 40: Discrete Systems:
1. Discrete time dynamical systems 
2. Fixed Point iteration
3. Cobweb plot
4. Period 3 Cycles 
5. Logistic maps 
6. Bifurication

Five Questions:
1. For fixed point iteration problems, will there always be a given value for alpha? If not, how do we find that value?
2. I see multiple patterns in Figure 40.3 for the iterations on f(n) = n - n^2 + 2. But how are they picking the 3 vallues for the period cycle by looking at the graph?
3. In Sarkovoskii's theorem, what does the sign that looks like a less than sign combined with an arrow mean?
4. What does "least period k" mean?
5. When determining if the fixed point iteration is guarenteed to converge, where are the valuse of a and x coming from in teh quations used in the textbook?
